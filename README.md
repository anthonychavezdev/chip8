# Introduction
This is a Chip8 emulator I wrote in C over the summer.
I programmed as I went, there was no planning involved,
or writing any documentation. The goal was to just make it work.
I was planning on rewriting the code base to make it cleaner, and
I was planning on writing documentation eventually, but I honestly don't feel
like it anymore.

# How to compile
You'll need to install the SDL2 development libraries.

```git clone https://gitlab.com/anthonychavez/chip8```

## Fedora
```sudo dnf install SDL2-devel make clang```
```make```

## Ubuntu and Debian
```sudo apt install libsdl2-dev make clang```
```make```
